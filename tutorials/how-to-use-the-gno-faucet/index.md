# Overview

When you interact with a live gno.land network—whether it’s a test network or the main network—you need tokens to pay for on-chain activities like executing or deploying smart contracts. On a main network, tokens usually have real value to compensate the node operators. However, for development and testing, you use test tokens that carry no real-world value. 

**Faucet**:
A _faucet_ is a virtual tap that provides small amounts of these test tokens for free. The gno.land ecosystem has a built-in faucet you can use to request tokens so you can develop, test, and explore without incurring real-money expenses.

> **Note:** You must have a gno.land account and wallet before using the faucet. If you need to create one, see the [Installing Adena Wallet and Creating Your First Account](#) tutorial for guidance.

## What You'll Learn

By following this tutorial, you will:

1. Understand what a blockchain faucet is and its purpose in the gno.land ecosystem.  
2. Learn how to request GNOT tokens from the gno.land faucet to use for testing and development.  
3. Gain familiarity with the basic steps and tools needed to get started on gno.land.

## What You'll Need

- A gno.land wallet (e.g., [Adena Wallet](#))  
- A valid gno.land account address  
- Basic understanding of how to copy/paste addresses and complete a web form  

---

## What You'll Do

1. **Access the Faucet**: Navigate to the faucet page and select the desired gno.land network (Testnet/Devnet).  
2. **Request GNOT Tokens**: Paste your wallet address, specify an amount of GNOT, and complete the CAPTCHA to receive your tokens.  
3. **Verify the Transaction**: Confirm that you have successfully received your tokens in your wallet.

## The Tutorial Itself

### 1. Access the Faucet

1. Go to [https://faucet.gno.land](https://faucet.gno.land).  
2. You will see a **Welcome to the Faucet Hub** page, listing supported gno.land networks.  
3. Pick the network you want tokens for, such as **Testnet** or **Devnet** (depending on your goal).

### 2. Get Tokens

1. After selecting a network, a dialog with a short form will open.  
2. In the **Enter your wallet address** field, paste the address of the wallet you want to fund.  
   - If you don’t have a wallet yet, see the [Installing Adena Wallet and Creating Your First Account](#) tutorial.  
3. Specify the amount of **GNOT** you need. Request only what is necessary for testing.  
4. Complete the **I am not a robot** CAPTCHA.  
5. Click **Request drip**.

If the request is successful, you’ll see a **Faucet Request Successful** message. This indicates your wallet has received the tokens.

## Test or Verify Your Tokens

You can verify that the tokens have arrived in your wallet by checking your wallet’s balance. If you do not see a new balance, try refreshing or restarting your wallet application.

## Next Steps

Congratulations! You’ve successfully requested and received GNOT tokens from the gno.land faucet. You can now interact with test or development networks, execute or deploy smart contracts, and explore gno.land without spending real money.

- **Use Tokens Responsibly**: Only request the tokens you need, and remember these tokens have no real monetary value.  
- **Keep Learning**: Check out other tutorials, such as [Using The Adena Wallet](#) or advanced guides on writing and deploying smart contracts.  
- **Join the Community**: If you have questions or run into issues, consider asking in the gno.land community channels (e.g., Discord).  

Enjoy experimenting and building on gno.land!
