# Creating a Secure Wallet on Adena: A Step-by-Step Guide

Creating a web3 wallet may seem intimidating if you're unfamiliar with blockchain, but this guide will help you through every step. Adena offers a user-friendly process for creating a wallet with an emphasis on security and simplicity. This tutorial will break down each step, providing explanations on why they're important.

## Understanding Wallets, Addresses, and Accounts

Before we dive into creating a wallet, let’s explore what a wallet is, how it connects with a blockchain address, and what an account means in the web3 world. 

### What is a Wallet?

A **wallet** in web3 is a digital tool that allows you to store, send, and receive assets, such as cryptocurrency or NFTs (non-fungible tokens). Unlike traditional wallets that hold physical currency, a web3 wallet holds cryptographic keys (unique codes) that allow you to access your assets on the blockchain.

### How Does an On-Chain Address Relate to the Wallet?

An **on-chain address** is like a public identifier on the blockchain. Think of it as your public-facing "bank account number." When you create a wallet, it generates this address, which you can share with others so they can send assets to you. However, the address only acts as a destination—it doesn’t hold the assets. The blockchain itself keeps the record of what belongs to each address.

### What is an Account?

An **account** is essentially the combination of your address and the assets associated with it on the blockchain. When you use a wallet, you’re managing an account on the blockchain, and this account keeps track of your assets and transactions. The account is represented by the on-chain address, while the wallet software allows you to interact with it.

In summary, your **wallet** stores your keys, your **address** is your public identifier on the blockchain, and your **account** is your balance and transaction history linked to that address. Together, these elements let you securely manage and control your blockchain assets.

## Step 1: Access Advanced Options

After opening the Adena app, begin by navigating to **Advanced Options**. In this section, select **Create New Wallet**. Advanced options are designed to give you more control over wallet creation. By choosing this, you’re opting to create a wallet that’s fully under your control—a step toward self-custody in web3.

## Step 2: Acknowledge Seed Phrase Storage

When you create a wallet, Adena will generate a unique "seed phrase" for you. This is a sequence of random words that serve as your wallet's master key. Adena requires you to **confirm your understanding** that this seed phrase will be stored locally on your device, not on any external servers. 

**Why is this important?** In the world of web3, owning your wallet’s keys means you own your assets. Unlike traditional online accounts, which often have password recovery options, blockchain-based wallets rely solely on your seed phrase for access. If you lose your seed phrase, you lose access to your wallet permanently. It’s essential to keep this phrase safe, as only you can access it.

## Step 3: Answer the Security Questionnaire

Before proceeding, Adena presents a security questionnaire. This is to help you understand some essential concepts and responsibilities involved in wallet management.

The questionnaire covers questions such as:

- **What is a seed phrase, and why is it important?**
  - **Explanation**: This question highlights the importance of the seed phrase as the primary way to recover your wallet. Knowing this prepares you to store it carefully.
- **Who should have access to your seed phrase?**
  - **Explanation**: The answer here is ideally “only you.” This question emphasizes the need for secrecy—anyone with access to your seed phrase has complete control over your wallet and assets.
- **What happens if you lose your seed phrase?**
  - **Explanation**: The answer is that access to the wallet is lost forever. This question reinforces the irreversibility of losing the phrase, stressing the importance of backing it up.

These questions may seem simple, but they are fundamental to ensuring that you’re prepared to manage your own wallet securely.

## Step 4: Generate and View Your Seed Phrase

Once you've completed the questionnaire, Adena will generate a unique seed phrase. You’ll see a warning screen explaining the seed phrase's importance and advising you not to share it with anyone or store it in unsafe locations, like online note-taking apps.

**Viewing the Seed Phrase**: Hold down the button to reveal your seed phrase. This is a sensitive step, so Adena requires you to press and hold to view it, ensuring that you don’t accidentally skip over this part. 

**Why This Step Matters**: If you accidentally lose access to your wallet (for example, by forgetting your password), this seed phrase will be the only way to regain access. Think of it as your ultimate backup.

## Step 5: Write Down and Secure Your Seed Phrase

Take a moment to carefully **write down your seed phrase on paper** or another offline, secure location. Avoid typing it into anything connected to the internet to prevent accidental exposure. Store this record in a safe place where it won’t be lost, damaged, or accessible to anyone else.

**Why Paper Backup?** Paper is secure from online threats like hacking and malware. Many web3 users keep their seed phrase offline to avoid exposure to potential cyber-attacks. Some may even store it in multiple locations or lock it in a safe to ensure it's protected from loss or theft.

## Step 6: Create a Strong Password

Now that your seed phrase is secured, create a strong, unique password for daily access to your wallet. This password is used to unlock your wallet, and while it’s not as critical as the seed phrase, it’s still essential to protect it.

**Password Tips**: 
- Avoid easily guessable passwords.
- Use a mix of letters, numbers, and special characters.
- Consider using a password manager if you find it hard to remember complex passwords.

This password adds an extra layer of protection, so even if someone gains access to your device, they would need to know the password to access your wallet.

## Step 7: Complete Setup

After securing your seed phrase and setting up your password, you're ready to finalize your wallet creation. Adena may offer you the option to **pin the wallet** for easy access within the app.

Congratulations! Your wallet setup is now complete, and you have successfully taken your first steps into managing a secure web3 wallet. Remember, your seed phrase is your most valuable asset when it comes to wallet security.
