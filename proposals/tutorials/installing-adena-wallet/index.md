# **Installing Adena Wallet and Creating Your First Account**

## **What Is a Wallet, Anyway?**

A wallet in the context of blockchain is a tool that helps you to manage your access to a blockchain. Contrary to what the name suggests, a blockchain wallet does not actually hold your tokens or digital assets. Rather, it stores private keys, which are special, secret numbers which are essential for securely accessing and managing the assets recorded on the blockchain.

The primary purpose of a wallet is to make blockchain technology both accessible and secure. Private keys function like a password; they ensure that only the person possessing them can access or transfer the assets associated with their account. Without wallets, interacting with the blockchain would be highly technical and challenging for most people. Wallets simplify the process and provide a user-friendly interface for sending, receiving, and managing blockchain-based assets.

In addition to their core function of managing your private keys and facilitating transactions, wallets are often used to interact with decentralized applications, also called _dApps_. They also enable users to securely store their digital assets, which can include cryptocurrencies, tokens, and non-fungible tokens (NFTs). Depending on the type of wallet, the level of convenience and security varies. Without going into too much abstract detail, wallets are typically placed into two categories, hot wallets and cold wallets.

Hot wallets, such as mobile applications or browser extensions, are connected to the internet, making them convenient for everyday use. 

On the other hand, cold wallets are often specialized hardware devices. They are not internet connected, which makes them less convenient to use, trading the ease of use of hot wallets for an increased level of security because of that isolation from direct contact with the internet.

Regardless of the type of wallet, thought, a blockchain wallet serves as the gateway to your digital assets and interactions on a blockchain network. By securely managing your private keys, it ensures that you remain in control of your blockchain identity and assets.

In this tutorial, you will install the **Adena Wallet** and set up your first account on [gno.land](https://gno.land). This tutorial is accessible for all experience levels with web3 technologies, other blockchains, or gno.land.

## **Introducing the Adena Wallet**

To effectively engage with gno.land, a compatible digital wallet is essential. The Adena Wallet is the first wallet written to service this ecosystem. It can be installed as a browser extension on a variety of platforms, including Chrome, Edge, Brave. In addition, there is a Firefox extension, and mobile apps available from both the Google Play Store and the Apple App Store coming soon.

Now, let's get your wallet set up.

## **Installing the Adena Wallet**

### **Step 1: Open Your Preferred Platform**

From your browser, navigate to the [adena.app](https://www.adena.app/#download) to download the correct extension.

### **Step 2: Select Your Platform**

You will see page like this:

![Adena Platforms](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/gnoverse/gnome-content/refs/heads/main/assets/tutorials/installing-adena-wallet/adena-download.png)

Select your platform.

### **Step 3: Install Adena**

While the exact steps may vary slightly depending on the browser you are using, the installation page should look similar to the one shown here. Follow the on-screen prompts to successfully complete the installation.

![Install Adena on Brave](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/gnoverse/gnome-content/refs/heads/main/assets/tutorials/installing-adena-wallet/install-adena-on-brave.png)


After installation, the welcome screen appears

![Adena Welcome #1](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/gnoverse/gnome-content/refs/heads/main/assets/tutorials/installing-adena-wallet/adena-welcome-1.png)

The welcome screen provides an explanation of the main three options, _Hardware Wallet_, _Airgap Account_, and _Advanced Options_.

Click on _I got it_, and step through the next steps.

## **Creating Your gno.land Account**

Congratulations, you've gotten the walled installed. Now let's create an account.

### **Step 1: Launch Adena Wallet**

* Click on the Advanced Options button.  

Adena is very security focused, and the more secure options are to have a hardware wallet or an airgapped account. However, if you are new to web3 and blockchain, it is unlikely that you will have a hardware wallet, nor will having an airgapped account necessarily make the most sense to you. Additionally, if you are going to be doing smart contract development with gno.land, you will find having a hot wallet in your browser to be very convenient for working with live gno.land networks.

Because of the security focus of Adena, this option exists within _Advanced Options_. Click on it.

![Adena Welcome #3](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/gnoverse/gnome-content/refs/heads/main/assets/tutorials/installing-adena-wallet/adena-options.png)

### **Step 2: Advanced Options**

Adena will provide three options. You can create a new wallet, import a wallet, or Sign in With Google. We are going to choose the first option, _Create New Wallet_, but the _Sign in With Google_ options is worth mentioning. It will create a wallet based on Google Open Authentication, which can be very useful. After completing this tutorial, consider going back and exploring this option yourself.

![Advanced Options](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/gnoverse/gnome-content/refs/heads/main/assets/tutorials/installing-adena-wallet/advanced-options.png)

Click on the _Create New Wallet_ option.

### **Step 3: Pass the Quiz**

Adena is going to walk you through a simple instructional quiz to ensure that you understand how to keep your data safe. This is important, as poor data safety decisions can compromise the safety of your wallet.

It starts with this screen:

![pass-the-quiz-1](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/gnoverse/gnome-content/refs/heads/main/assets/tutorials/installing-adena-wallet/pass-the-quiz-1.png)

Press the _Next_ link.

#### **Complete a Questionaire**

![Complete a Questionaire](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/gnoverse/gnome-content/refs/heads/main/assets/tutorials/installing-adena-wallet/pass-the-quiz-2.png)

Click _Next_.

#### Who Can Recover Your Seed Phrase or Private Key?

![Who Can Recover Your Seed Phrase or Private Key?](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/gnoverse/gnome-content/refs/heads/main/assets/tutorials/installing-adena-wallet/pass-the-quiz-3.png)

Because all of your security depends on keeping your seed phrase and private key safe, there is no capability for anyone else to recover it for you. Ensure that you don't forget it or lose it.

Click _Nobody_ and then press _Next_. 

#### Security Questionnaire About Adena Support

![Security Questionnaire About Adena Support](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/gnoverse/gnome-content/refs/heads/main/assets/tutorials/installing-adena-wallet/pass-the-quiz-4.png)

This question asks you how you should interact with Adena Support. Refer back to the previous question. Your wallet's security completely depends on the sanctity of your seed phrase and private key. Adena Support would never ask for this information. If anybody asks for it, ignore the request and end the conversation.

Click _Ignore the request and end the conversation_ and then press _Next_.

#### Security Questionnaire About Safe Storage

![Security Questionnaire About Sage Storage](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/gnoverse/gnome-content/refs/heads/main/assets/tutorials/installing-adena-wallet/pass-the-quiz-5.png)

This question is asking about safe storage for your seed phrase. Remember that nobody can recover this for you, so it is important that you remember it. However, because security of your seed phrase is crucial, the safe storage of that seed phrase is crucial. It is up to you to determine the best way to do this, but it must be a secure offline environment in order to maintain the highest level of security.

Click _A Secure Offline Environment_ and press _Next_.

#### You've Completed the Questionnaire

![You've Passed the Security Questionnaire](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/gnoverse/gnome-content/refs/heads/main/assets/tutorials/installing-adena-wallet/pass-the-quiz-6.png)

Congratulations, you understand the basic steps needed to keep your data safe. Let's finish making your account.
